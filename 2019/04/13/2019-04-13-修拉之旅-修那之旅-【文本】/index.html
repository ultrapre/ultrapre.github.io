<pre><code>SHUNA&apos;S JOURNEY manga review by Lorraine Savage, founder of Anime</code></pre><p>  Hasshin and editor of THE ROSE fanzine (from THE ROSE Vol. 4, #23):</p>
<p>MANGA REVIEW</p>
<p>SHUNA’S JOURNEY</p>
<p>by Lorraine Savage</p>
<pre><code>Hayao Miyazaki&apos;s comic prose (no word balloons) book of 1983 is the</code></pre><p>story of a young prince in search of a special grain so he can feed his</p>
<p>starving people.  The book is another epic masterpiece by the creator of</p>
<p>Nausicaa’s polluted world, the majestic castle in the sky, and the</p>
<p>enchanting Totoros (among other great stories).  SHUNA’S JOURNEY is a</p>
<p>little, full color manga book by AM Juju, 380 yen, that appeared with</p>
<p>Animage magazine.</p>
<pre><code>Miyazaki&apos;s graceful water colors embrace this story.  Shuna&apos;s</code></pre><p>village is deep within a valley surrounded by high cliffs, and peopled</p>
<p>with old, bushy-mustached patriarchs (true to Miyazaki’s style).  The</p>
<p>painted landscapes, nightscapes and sunsets are portrayed in a beautiful</p>
<p>range of colors.  Those who enjoy the water color stills from the Famous</p>
<p>Detective Holmes episodes will adore this book.</p>
<pre><code>The story, as translated by Kevin Leahy, can be read and understood</code></pre><p>just as it is, without the pictures in the book.  Since there is little</p>
<p>dialogue in the book, translation consists mostly of exposition.</p>
<pre><code>The beginning of the story has the flavor of an old Japanese folk</code></pre><p>tale or a Brothers Grimm tale.  However, the sudden introduction of an</p>
<p>outside entity in the middle of the story didn’t quite seem appropriate.</p>
<p>Except for that mysterious force, the story could well take place in</p>
<p>Nausicaa’s era, in some land far from her valley.  In many ways this is a</p>
<p>dark story, with slavery, poverty, assassins in the night; but it also</p>
<p>has courage, hope and determination.</p>
<pre><code>My only complaint: Miyazaki still needs to broaden his scope of</code></pre><p>character designing.  With his helmet off, Shuna looks <em>exactly</em> like</p>
<p>Nausicaa sans earrings!</p>
<pre><code>SHUNA&apos;S JOURNEY translation with page and panel breaks indicated:

          Anime Hasshin presents a translation of . . .

          SHUNA&apos;S JOURNEY, a/k/a THE JOURNEY OF SHUNA</code></pre><p>*written, drawn, and watercolored by Hayao Miyazaki in 1983</p>
<p>*published by ANIMAGE magazine’s AM JUJU books in June 1983</p>
<p>*translated by Kevin Leahy (first mentioned in THE ROSE #23, Sept. 1990)</p>
<p>*slotted into page and panel designations by Steven Feldman in July 1991</p>
<p>*corrections to #P136,BL# and #P145# by Tsao Sheng-Te, August 1991</p>
<pre><code>A short note about manga and this copy of Mr. Leahy&apos;s translation:</code></pre><p>First, manga are read from right to left–not only from page to page, but</p>
<p>from panel to panel.  Second, this translation shortens “page and panel”</p>
<p>to “#P__,__#” to allow for variations of panel placement.  For example,</p>
<p>“#P48,TR#” means “page 48, top right panel,” and “#P96,MM#” means “page</p>
<p>96, middle row, middle panel.”  Third, only the first page of each of the</p>
<p>manga’s six chapters has an actual, typed page number (the others have no</p>
<p>number).  Finally, the bracketed stuff indicates Kevin’s comments,</p>
<p>whereas the parenthetical remarks are mine.</p>
<p>(CHAPTER ONE:)  #P4#  DEPARTURE</p>
<pre><code>What time is this?  At the present it isn&apos;t clear.  Is it in far</code></pre><p>gone antiquity?  Could it possibly be in the distant future?  In the</p>
<p>bottom of an ancient valley scooped out of glaciers is the little kingdom</p>
<p>that time abandoned.</p>
<pre><code>#P6,R#  Why would anyone want to live in this land?  #P6,L#  Time</code></pre><p>and again the winds blow thin air down from the mountains.  Nor are the</p>
<p>days of the sun so kind as to warm the valley.</p>
<pre><code>#P8#  Scratching at the dry soil, planting Hiwabie seedling, but the</code></pre><p>barren earth begrudges them so much as the smallest harvest.</p>
<pre><code>#P9#  The Yakkul are always hungry for the scant Grass and don&apos;t</code></pre><p>produce very many offspring at all…</p>
<pre><code>#P10,T#  But the people give thanks for their little harvests...</code></pre><p>#P10,B#  In the end they’re just living to work, to die…</p>
<pre><code>#P11,T#  Why is the life of man so pathetically poor?  #P11,M#  Why</code></pre><p>is nature so beautiful but cruel?</p>
<pre><code>#P11,B#  The young man&apos;s name is Shuna.  Before long he&apos;ll have</code></pre><p>inherited this kingdom from his father.</p>
<pre><code>[One day, Shuna happens across a suffering stranger.]  #P12#  The</code></pre><p>man was from a foreign land, in garments like he’s never seen, and dying</p>
<p>of hunger and fatigue.</p>
<pre><code>#P13#  Visitors to this valley were few.  And so it was the custom</code></pre><p>of the valley to treat these rare guests with courtesy.  #P14,R#  But the</p>
<p>spells and medicinal herbs of the valley’s foremost old woman couldn’t</p>
<p>tie the life to the traveler.  #P14,L#  “As the moon sets this very night</p>
<p>he shall be released from his lengthy torment,” she said.</p>
<pre><code>#P15,T#  The traveler beckoned Shuna to his death bed. &quot;I am the</code></pre><p>prince of a small country far off in the eastern part of this world.</p>
<p>It’s a poor country.  My subjects were always worried about starving.</p>
<p>#P15,BR#  One day, when I was young, like you, I ran across a lone</p>
<p>traveler.”</p>
<pre><code>#P15,BL#  The man took the little bag he wore around his neck and</code></pre><p>showed it to Shuna.  #P16,T#  Seeds like Shuna had never seen came</p>
<p>flowing from the bag.</p>
<pre><code>&quot;This is what that traveler gave me.  If only I had this grain,</code></pre><p>there’s no way the people could starve.  They could live in abundance,</p>
<p>in peace…”</p>
<pre><code>That seed was of great importance.

#P17#  Shuna said, &quot;Our Hiwabie seeds are small and meager.  Could</code></pre><p>we not have this species?”</p>
<pre><code>&quot;Giving you this is fine but sowing it in the soil is useless...</code></pre><p>The husk on this seed is peeling.  It’s dying already.  While living,</p>
<p>this species is wrapped in a gold-colored husk. Sparkling as beautifully</p>
<p>as anything you’ve ever heard of.  I wanted to keep the people from pain.</p>
<p>Until today, I was searching for the golden species.  The journey</p>
<p>continued on and on.  Quickly, I grew old…and my strength, too, was</p>
<p>spent…”  #P16,B#  “Over yonder, to the west, where the ground has been</p>
<p>used, the golden grain makes fertile waves roll across the land…” [he</p>
<p>said.]</p>
<pre><code>#P18,T#  When the traveler died, he left within Shuna&apos;s heart a</code></pre><p>burning idea.  Since then, Shuna frequently would look firmly in the</p>
<p>direction of the west.</p>
<pre><code>#P18,B#  Troubled at heart, his father and the elders addressed</code></pre><p>Shuna.  “If we are poor it is only because it is our destiny.  It is the</p>
<p>duty of a person to be buried here, to be embraced by this land.”</p>
<pre><code>#P19,T#  But as the time to depart approached, it looked like no one</code></pre><p>could convince him…and the elders were gravely disappointed.</p>
<pre><code>#P19,B#  The women were always gathering, and seeing the excessive</code></pre><p>number of bullets he had, they knew of the rigid nature of his</p>
<p>determination.</p>
<pre><code>#P20#  Violating the law while everyone slept on the night of the</code></pre><p>new moon, Shuna saddled his yakkul and left.</p>
<p>(CHAPTER TWO:)  #P22#  TO THE WEST</p>
<pre><code>In an area where the earth was rotting into pits and rust floated</code></pre><p>on the surface of the water, he continued on to the bitter end.  The</p>
<p>wind came and it carried a stench.</p>
<pre><code>So many days, day after day, Shuna and his yakkul walked to the west</code></pre><p>without seeing a single living thing.  #P25#  There were only the things</p>
<p>that people had left behind.  Some time ago, they must have moved far</p>
<p>away from there…</p>
<pre><code>#P26,T#  In the first month after emerging from the valley, standing</code></pre><p>far off on the horizon, Shuna saw smoke rising from human habitations.</p>
<pre><code>#P26,B#  It was a ship constructed of wood and stone.

#P27#  It was exceedingly large.  Possibly, it was damaged some time</code></pre><p>after its departure.  Now, it seems to have reached a port.</p>
<pre><code>#P29#  &quot;I&apos;m one suffering the hardships of a journey.  Would you be</code></pre><p>so kind as to permit me one night’s lodging?” Shuna asked.</p>
<pre><code>#P30,T#  The place where a woman pointed looked like the entrance to</code></pre><p>a cave.</p>
<pre><code>#P30,B#  At his feet there was a dry crunching sound.  The muscles</code></pre><p>of his back turned cold as ice.</p>
<pre><code>#P31,T#  Shuna vaulted onto his yakkul and left there at full speed.</code></pre><p>Behind him, the shouts of the woman could be heard.</p>
<pre><code>#P31,R#  The scattered pieces of bone were clearly human.  There</code></pre><p>were signs that they had been burned and broken right to the marrow.</p>
<p>#P31,L#  [Shuna thought,] “These must be the ghouls, the cannibals</p>
<p>I’ve heard rumors about…”</p>
<pre><code>[That night, by the light of his campfire, a dozing Shuna is</code></pre><p>attacked by veiled women (who look like Dorok priests).  He frees himself</p>
<p>from their ropes and severely injures one with his gun, dispersing the</p>
<p>group.]  #P36#  Just as they had come, the attackers were gone, without a</p>
<p>sound.</p>
<pre><code>#P37,T#  No, that wasn&apos;t entirely true.  He could hear the</code></pre><p>whimpering of the badly maimed one.  #P37,B#  The whimpering voice went</p>
<p>beyond the sand dune, and little by little, grew fainter and fainter…</p>
<pre><code>#P39,T#  The provisions they took out of the valley had been</code></pre><p>consumed.  Shuna and his yakkul were starving.  #P38,M#  In order to eat,</p>
<p>he killed.  #P38,B#  In order to survive, he had to make every effort</p>
<p>possible.</p>
<pre><code>#P39,B#  Little by little, time lost its meaning.  How many days</code></pre><p>had passed since he left the valley?  Shuna no longer knew.</p>
<pre><code>#P40#  The air grew thick.  Before long, he had seen oh so many</code></pre><p>abandoned villages.  #P41,T#  The people who lived here, where on earth</p>
<p>could they have gone?</p>
<pre><code>#P41,MR#  The fields of crops had returned to a completely wild</code></pre><p>state.  The meager seeds had become nothing more than Hiwabie.  #P41,L#</p>
<p>He thought, “The seed I’m searching for isn’t here…”</p>
<pre><code>#P43#  Traveling westward again, Shuna ran across a huge vehicle</code></pre><p>drawn by a team of horses.  But when he called up to them from the road,</p>
<p>the men only ridiculed Shuna’s old-fashioned gun and gave no information.</p>
<p>#P44,T#  An offensive odor came drifting from the armored vehicle.</p>
<p>Seeing the cargo, Shuna received a shock.</p>
<pre><code>People had been herded into it.  What on earth for?

#P44,B#  Some number of identical vehicles also passed.  A town,</code></pre><p>sprawling across the devastated plain, came into view.</p>
<p>(CHAPTER THREE:)  #P45,R#  IN THE CASTLE TOWN</p>
<pre><code>#P45,L#  Forty thousand lived in the castle town.  People and</code></pre><p>vehicles were coming and going constantly through the main gate.</p>
<pre><code>#P46#  Inside the castle, a forest of towers that had begun to</code></pre><p>collapse, was the liveliest, noisiest place Shuna had ever seen.  #P47#</p>
<p>How could you describe it… If you do business in this town, your main</p>
<p>stock is people.</p>
<pre><code>#P48,TR#  The seed he desired couldn&apos;t be in this place.  #P48,TL#</code></pre><p>If he got some provisions, he could leave here soon.</p>
<pre><code>#P48,B#  Shuna offered the jewel adorning his sword hilt to the</code></pre><p>merchant and his attitude promptly changed.  In the front of his shop all</p>
<p>sorts of beans and grains formed mountains.</p>
<pre><code>#P49,T#  Shuna&apos;s eyes became riveted to one mountain in particular.</code></pre><p>There was the seed he desired.  But threshing had made it completely</p>
<p>lifeless.  Shuna inquired of the merchant if there wasn’t any living</p>
<p>seed.</p>
<pre><code>&quot;There really aren&apos;t any other dealers of farm-related goods.  When</code></pre><p>wheat is needed, it’s just brought from someplace else.”</p>
<pre><code>&quot;Well, isn&apos;t that wheat grown in this vicinity?&quot;

&quot;The slave traders are waiting to exchange their people, so why</code></pre><p>don’t you go ask the slave traders?”</p>
<pre><code>[Shuna approaches a group of heavily armed men.]  #P49,BR#  &quot;Did you</code></pre><p>say slave traders?  We’re man hunters,” [one of them said.]</p>
<pre><code>#P49,BL#  &quot;The ones he bought it from, do you know where they</code></pre><p>brought that booty from?” (asked Shuna.)</p>
<pre><code>#P50,T#  The lips of the men became hostilely stiff and they were as</code></pre><p>silent as stone statues.</p>
<pre><code>#P50,B#  Shuna was exhausted...

[As he sits down to rest and eat the last of his provisions, Shuna</code></pre><p>sees a little girl and her sister chained to a building.]  #P51,M#  “Even</p>
<p>this little girl…” he thought.</p>
<pre><code>[He offers her the last of his food.]  #P51,B#  &quot;Eat.&quot; (he says.)

[A fat merchant appears in the window behind the two slaves.]

#P52#  &quot;My good traveling man, that pair has caught your eye, and an</code></pre><p>eye for quality it is.  #P53,TR#  These sisters are blood descendants of</p>
<p>a certain royal family, you know.  #P53,TL#  Make a fine wife for a noble</p>
<p>man.  Make a fine serving girl.  #P53,MR#  And they come incredibly</p>
<p>cheap.  Well, what will it be?  Your mount in exchange - I can’t think of</p>
<p>a deal more to my disadvantage…”</p>
<pre><code>#P53,ML#  Shuna began to ponder, &quot;If I gave these two their</code></pre><p>freedom…”</p>
<pre><code>Shuna was perplexed.  &quot;But if I part with the yakkul, this journey</code></pre><p>can’t continue.  I don’t have any more jewels,” he told himself.</p>
<pre><code>#P53,B#  &quot;You seem satisfied,&quot; the merchant said.  &quot;Congratulations.</code></pre><p>Say, that’s a really old-fashioned gun, but I’m sure I can give you</p>
<p>something in exchange.”</p>
<pre><code>#P54,T#  &quot;You shouldn&apos;t do that!&quot;  Suddenly, the young lady sprung</code></pre><p>up.  #P54,MR#  “If you trade away your weapon you’ll be hunted down, too.</p>
<p>#P54,ML#  What’s more, we aren’t from any royal family, but we don’t want</p>
<p>to be bought by you.”</p>
<p>  #P54,BR#  “Shut up!  #P54,BL#  I’ll show you who’s the master here.”</p>
<p>[The slave merchant knocks the older of the two girls to the ground.]</p>
<pre><code>#P55,TR#  When it looked as if he would try to stop it, Shuna was</code></pre><p>surrounded by patrolmen.  #P55,TL#  “If you don’t want to, die, hold your</p>
<p>tongue,” [one advised him.]</p>
<pre><code>#P55,M#  [The merchant bellowed,] &quot;Get out of here, you penniless</code></pre><p>bastard, or you’ll be serenading me with more screams of that sort.”</p>
<pre><code>#P55,B#  He couldn&apos;t help but leave...

#P56#  Suddenly, the tears began to fall, on and on, and they would</code></pre><p>not stop.</p>
<pre><code>[Later that night, Shuna sits by a fire alone until a squat old man</code></pre><p>pops up from behind a rock.]  #P57#  “Oh, that’s not a fire, is it?  (the</p>
<p>man asked.)  I’m frozen.  You’ll be so kind as to let a miserable old man</p>
<p>warm himself, won’t you?  #P58,T#  Well, this old man certainly has the</p>
<p>good luck to run into a kind person.  Isn’t that right?  Wouldn’t you</p>
<p>say?  Can I have one of those Nan?  Ha ha ha!”</p>
<pre><code>#P58,BR#  &quot;At the slave market...&quot; he (Shuna) repeated.  [Soon, the</code></pre><p>old man has heard of the day’s events.]</p>
<pre><code>&quot;I&apos;m searching for the golden seeds to help the people of the</code></pre><p>valley.  That was my intent.  In front of my own eyes, just a little</p>
<p>girl, and I couldn’t save her…”</p>
<pre><code>#P58,BL#  &quot;He he he... And because of this you say you&apos;ve lost your</code></pre><p>confidence?  #59,T#  Why don’t you run back to your homeland?  You lived</p>
<p>the pampered, protected life of a prince there, didn’t you?”</p>
<pre><code>[The old man takes another Nan dumpling.]  #P59,MR#  &quot;Ooh, that&apos;s</code></pre><p>hot… You shouldn’t want the golden species and things like that.”</p>
<pre><code>#P59,BR#  &quot;Old man, do you know where the golden seeds are?&quot;

&quot;I might.&quot;

#P59,BL#  &quot;Please tell me where I should go.&quot;

&quot;Ha ha ha... I&apos;ll take another of those Nan first...&quot;

#P60#  (Continuing, the old man said,)  &quot;Once again, it&apos;s best to</code></pre><p>proceed westward, until cliffs mark the end of the land.  That’s the</p>
<p>point where the dead are born of the moon in the land of the god-like</p>
<p>ones.”</p>
<pre><code>&quot;God-like ones...?&quot;

&quot;They&apos;re the ones who used to have the golden species.  Harvest</code></pre><p>from the water, plant in the water, water’s what gives it life.  Now,</p>
<p>only the god-like ones have that species.  What they trade to the human</p>
<p>race, that seems to be just dead seed that they get.”</p>
<pre><code>&quot;The god-like ones won&apos;t be glad to associate with a person.  I&apos;ll</code></pre><p>head to that region - I won’t bother them.”</p>
<pre><code>#P61,TR#  &quot;You&apos;ll go?  You will go, won&apos;t you?  Then it&apos;s decided.&quot;</code></pre><p>Having said that, the old man went to sleep.</p>
<pre><code>#P61,B#  Around daybreak, Shuna awoke, but the form of the old man</code></pre><p>was no longer there.  Shuna departed, facing himself first to the east…</p>
<p>(CHAPTER FOUR:)  #P62,TR#  THE ATTACK</p>
<pre><code>#P62,TL#  Shuna returned to the city of greed, sleeping behind a</code></pre><p>firmly barred main gate.  Ascending the castle wall, he went to that</p>
<p>alley from the previous day.  At the wall, the manacles were left undone</p>
<p>and he didn’t see any sign of the sisters.</p>
<pre><code>[Sword drawn, Shuna enters the merchant&apos;s bedroom.]  #P62,BR#  &quot;Get</code></pre><p>up!  Those sisters, where are they?!”</p>
<pre><code>#P62,BL#  &quot;You...you little bastard, that I can only guess.&quot;

#P63,TR#  To hear the truth from the mouth of the villainous slave</code></pre><p>merchant, Shuna didn’t hesitate to exercise his strength.</p>
<pre><code>#P63,TL#  During the night, the sisters had been sold to a slave</code></pre><p>trader going south.</p>
<pre><code>#P63,BR#  To the south, the yakkul began to give chase like the</code></pre><p>wind.  #P63,BL#  Shuna’s body felt as if it were overflowing with a</p>
<p>ferocious strength.</p>
<pre><code>#P65#  Discovering the slave trader&apos;s vehicle, Shuna wheeled around</code></pre><p>to the front and suddenly started firing from very close range.  It was a</p>
<p>perfect surprise attack.  Hunting snow leopards was just like this.</p>
<pre><code>Firing repeatedly with the coolness of a fiend, he did laps around</code></pre><p>the vehicle, shooting down the slave traders all the while.</p>
<pre><code>[It is only a matter of time before Shuna has killed all the</code></pre><p>guards.]</p>
<pre><code>#P66,T#  Shuna searched out the key ring and opened the iron door.</code></pre><p>“Even though you may be chased for the rest of your life, anyone who</p>
<p>wants his freedom should be good enough to get out.”</p>
<pre><code>#P66,B#  Only those two sisters stepped down.  Fearing revenge, the</code></pre><p>other people would not stand up.</p>
<pre><code>#P67,T#  &quot;Freedom can&apos;t be bought and sold,&quot; [Shuna said to the</code></pre><p>sisters.]  “Pride is the sword you fought with.  You are free.”</p>
<pre><code>#P67,B#  There was no more time for conversation.  On the horizon,</code></pre><p>the shape of pursuers from the town appeared.  “Let’s go!”  Shuna hoisted</p>
<p>the two sisters up into the saddle.</p>
<pre><code>#P69#  Burdened with three people, and heading east, the yakkul</code></pre><p>displayed magnificent running ability, immediately pulling out of the</p>
<p>range of vision of the pursuers.  But Shuna’s adversaries were skilled.</p>
<p>The pursuers recovered their senses.  By no means would they hurry.</p>
<p>#P70,T#  They were counting on the yakkul growing tired.  While they</p>
<p>made a respectable pace toward the horizon, Shuna was conscious of the</p>
<p>pursuers plodding along behind them.</p>
<pre><code>#P71,R#  They slept while they ran.  They ate while they fled.

#P71,L#  After two nights, the ground in front of them suddenly</code></pre><p>disappeared.  They had arrived at the limit end of the earth that the old</p>
<p>man had talked about.</p>
<pre><code>#P72,T#  The yakkul was frothing and needed to lie down.  Since</code></pre><p>three people had been put on it, and it had run excessively, it might</p>
<p>die.</p>
<pre><code>#P72,B#  &quot;The yakkul can be ridden with just you two.  I&apos;ll stay</code></pre><p>here and hold them off.”  The young lady said that they, too, would stay.</p>
<pre><code>Shuna told them, &quot;If I can kill our pursuers, then I can go to the</code></pre><p>land of the god-like ones as I intended.”</p>
<pre><code>#P73,T#  Knowing the purpose of Shuna&apos;s journey, the young lady bent</code></pre><p>forward.  Presently, she raised her face.  “If you return from the land</p>
<p>of the god-like ones, please be certain to advance north, up to the</p>
<p>north.  We will wait there forever for you to return.”  The young lady</p>
<p>said her name was Tea.  Shuna divided the water and provisions in half.</p>
<p>The time for separation had come.  Tea and her younger sister waved once</p>
<p>and were already looking back as they went quickly north and melted away.</p>
<pre><code>#P73,BR#  Shuna remembered how they set traps hunting goats in the</code></pre><p>valley.  He built so many small mounds of little stone surrounding the</p>
<p>edge of the cliff, and set powder cartridges.</p>
<pre><code>#P73,BL#  Digging into the sand, he buried himself and waited in</code></pre><p>silence.</p>
<pre><code>#P75,T#  When they entered the trap at the end of the path, Shuna</code></pre><p>sprang up.</p>
<pre><code>#P75,B#  Time after time, he shot bullets precisely where he&apos;d</code></pre><p>buried the powder cartridges, and with flashes and deafening roars, the</p>
<p>traps were all set off.  The animals panicked, and without a second</p>
<p>thought, rushed toward the cliff.  [The mounts of the manhunters run</p>
<p>blindly off the cliff, taking their riders with them.]</p>
<pre><code>#P77,T#  That time did it.  Shuna was enveloped in a bluish white</code></pre><p>light, like the collected brilliance of a hundred moons.  #P77,B#  There</p>
<p>was a huge gleaming face on it.  At an incredible speed, it shot across</p>
<p>the sky.  It was the moon.  #P78#  It left a broad trail of light behind</p>
<p>it that melted away as it went over there.  In an instant, it was a light</p>
<p>that flitted through the darkness to the opposite shore.</p>
<pre><code>It was the land of the god-like ones that the old man had talked</code></pre><p>about, where the moon returned the dead to life.  It was none other than</p>
<p>the place where the golden species he searched for was.</p>
<p>(CHAPTER FIVE:)  #P80,TR#  TO THE LAND OF THE GOD-LIKE ONES</p>
<pre><code>#P80,BL#  The end of the night wasn&apos;t clear.  Floating dust hid the</code></pre><p>opposite shore and thick clouds were expelled from the bottom of the</p>
<p>valley, making it impossible to see.  Shuna fixed his will and began the</p>
<p>descent of the vertical cliff.</p>
<pre><code>#P81#  He discovered innumerable ancient gods carved in the cliff,</code></pre><p>unseen from the top.  But shortly, the gods and their forgotten names</p>
<p>were lost as Shuna’s hands lowered him downward.</p>
<pre><code>#P82#  Entering the thick clouds, the light of the sun was blocked</code></pre><p>and visibility was low, making a world of darkness.  The shapes of the</p>
<p>gods disappeared and the skeletons of the dragons of ancient times were</p>
<p>jutting from the stone walls.  Shuna dropped down on the bones, on top</p>
<p>of bones that had lived through the very first night.</p>
<pre><code>#P84#  In the afternoon of the next day, the light of the sun</code></pre><p>slipped through a rift in the clouds for only a second, and for the first</p>
<p>time, the bottom of the valley was visible.  There was a beach there.</p>
<p>#P85#  What could he say…  #P87,T#  The land of the god-like ones</p>
<p>stretched out on the other side of the stormy sea.</p>
<pre><code>#P86#  Wouldn&apos;t it be nice not to be thirsty anymore!  An exhausted</code></pre><p>Shuna staggered into the water and washed his face, hands and feet.  The</p>
<p>water was bitterly cold.</p>
<pre><code>#P87,B#  Squatting down in that place, the strength left his body,</code></pre><p>and like sinking entirely into a thick sea, Shuna slept.</p>
<pre><code>#P88,T#  Shuna awoke with clear warm water lapping about him.  How</code></pre><p>long - the tide was rising.</p>
<pre><code>#P88,B#  It was like another world, calm and bright.  The waves of</code></pre><p>the day before were nowhere to be seen.  The shape of the sandbar was</p>
<p>visible.</p>
<pre><code>#P89#  A walk along the sandbar brought him to an island.  The tide</code></pre><p>had begun to fall.  The sea was teeming with living things.  Species that</p>
<p>had become extinct in distant antiquity were living there.  #P90#  The</p>
<p>island, too, was completely covered by signs of life.  Shuna had finally</p>
<p>set foot in the land of the god-like ones.</p>
<pre><code>#92#  This island was unspoiled by human footprints.  Pressing on</code></pre><p>into the dense forest and entering into the heart, the very heart.</p>
<pre><code>#P93#  Oh, that place should be so fruitful, such a peaceful world.</code></pre><p>#P94#  There wasn’t a single thing here to threaten him.  Shuna was</p>
<p>enveloped in tranquil feelings from the very bottom of his heart.</p>
<pre><code>[Some movement catches Shuna&apos;s eye.]  #P95,TR#  &quot;It&apos;s someone!&quot; he</code></pre><p>thinks.  #P95,TL#  Could it be one of the god-like ones?  The god-like</p>
<p>ones came from the human race, he was glad to say.  The words of the old</p>
<p>man were swept from his mind.</p>
<pre><code>#P95,B#  It was a green giant.  Silently and staggeringly it walked.</code></pre><p>After it, a great number of beasts and bugs followed.  #P96,MR#  When it</p>
<p>came to an open space in the forest, the giant stood still.</p>
<pre><code>#P96,MM#  Slowly thereafter, it collapsed.

#P96,ML#  What would come next, Shuna really didn&apos;t want to see.  A</code></pre><p>horde of small animals covered the giant and began eating it.</p>
<pre><code>#P96,BR&amp;L#  Before long, the horde moved away, and of the figure</code></pre><p>there was not so much as a bone remaining.</p>
<pre><code>#P97#  Just as he started down the path the giant had come plodding</code></pre><p>along, another giant appeared.  Though Shuna was in front of its eyes,</p>
<p>the giant was unaware of his presence.  With a tranquil expression, this</p>
<p>giant passed by, being wounded.  “It went to, die,” Shuna muttered,</p>
<p>trembling.</p>
<pre><code>#P98#  Again the giant proceeded, passing by, following one another</code></pre><p>in tranquility, just like people.  The giant swayed back and forth,</p>
<p>disappearing into the forest.</p>
<pre><code>All of a sudden, it was there before his eyes.  A strange, building-</code></pre><p>like thing towered from the center of bare farmland.</p>
<pre><code>The farmland itself was well-ploughed, and something like waterways</code></pre><p>ran through it in every direction.</p>
<pre><code>#P100,R#  This thing wasn&apos;t stone and it wasn&apos;t metal, and to the</code></pre><p>touch it was mysteriously warm and flexible.</p>
<pre><code>#P100,L#  He found an entrance, where the waterway continued into a</code></pre><p>cave, and began his tour of the building.</p>
<pre><code>#P101,T#  The interior was profoundly dark and a sweet perfume was</code></pre><p>drifting there.  Just as Shuna took another step toward the center of the</p>
<p>cave, he was stricken with panic that stood every hair on his body on</p>
<p>end.  Like a little critter, he ran back out into the forest.</p>
<pre><code>#P101,B#  That was no kind of building.  It was a living thing.</code></pre><p>Certainly, it was breathing…</p>
<pre><code>#P102#  In the dead of night, the moon returned and halted right</code></pre><p>over the top of the building.</p>
<pre><code>#P103,T#  Something began to be poured out of the mouth area of the</code></pre><p>moon.  It was people!!</p>
<pre><code>#P103,B#  Everything the old man had said was true.  The god-like</code></pre><p>ones collected people from the slave traders, and nothing else.</p>
<pre><code>#P105#  That enormous clot of people was completely swallowed, and</code></pre><p>the body began to shake slowly.  How much time could have passed?</p>
<pre><code>When the light of the moon finally subsided, phosphorescent fluid</code></pre><p>came gushing forth from those holes, circulating through the waterways of</p>
<p>the farmland.  Shuna saw it, this time.</p>
<pre><code>From the water, enormous figures rose, and green giants were &quot;born,&quot;</code></pre><p>as it were.</p>
<pre><code>#P104,B#  The people that were swallowed, were they transformed into</code></pre><p>giants, or the liquid that irrigated the farmland?  Shuna did not know.</p>
<p>swayingly, the giants spread out in the field and began sowing the golden</p>
<p>seeds from their mouths.</p>
<pre><code>Without resting, the giants then scooped water onto the fields they</code></pre><p>had sown.</p>
<pre><code>When the morning sun rose, the buds had sprouted.

At midday, the flowers were beginning to bloom.

#P108,T#  Seeing the gun by his side, Shuna was left breathless.</code></pre><p>#P108,B#  A half a day had elapsed, and it was completely rusted.  His</p>
<p>sword, too.  And his clothes were falling to pieces.</p>
<pre><code>#P109,TR#  He didn&apos;t want to waste any more time.  Things would</code></pre><p>change here with each approaching hour.</p>
<pre><code>#P109,TL#  The heads of grain were already beginning to change</code></pre><p>color.</p>
<pre><code>#P109,MR#  Shuna crossed the waterway.

#P111#  Just as Shuna&apos;s hand touched the heads of grain, the giants</code></pre><p>twisted their bodies, weeping and praying in unexpected voices.  “Oooh,</p>
<p>oooh,” they began to howl.  And at the same time, in Shuna’s mind,</p>
<p>someone’s voice was ringing - “Stop it!  Stop it!”  Shuna ignored this,</p>
<p>and forcibly took the heads of grain.</p>
<pre><code>#P112,R#  At the same time, Shuna&apos;s body was swept with shock as he</code></pre><p>fled, and a sharp pain pierced his heart.</p>
<pre><code>#P112,L#  Clenching his teeth, clutching the grain tightly, Shuna</code></pre><p>ran out of the field.</p>
<pre><code>#P113#  In confusion, he ran, escaping the forest.  The sea was</code></pre><p>getting stormy.  With eyesight dimming from the pain, Shuna jumped into</p>
<p>the dark sea.</p>
<p>(CHAPTER SIX:)  #P114#  TEA</p>
<pre><code>#P115#  After escaping, Tea and her younger sister made their way to</code></pre><p>this poor village of the north.  The days and months of a full year</p>
<p>seemed to stream by.</p>
<pre><code>#P116#  The two of them became good workers.  An old woman took them</code></pre><p>into her home.  And when they weren’t doing their normal jobs, the two</p>
<p>worked hard at reassuring the yakkul.</p>
<pre><code>#P117#  The old woman was sort of strange and ill-tempered, but she</code></pre><p>wasn’t a bad person.  Tea knew well that the complaining of an</p>
<p>unfortunate older person was common indeed.</p>
<pre><code>#P118,T#  The two were always hungry, and in that respect they were</code></pre><p>not unlike the people of this village.</p>
<pre><code>#P118,BR#  Tea was a brave young woman, not the sort to weep, but</code></pre><p>when the day was ended, not unlike a lover, she fell into a deep</p>
<p>depression.  #P118,BL#  What could have happened to Shuna?  As a sensible</p>
<p>young lady, Tea knew that she should not wait so patiently, but she</p>
<p>feared for Shuna’s safety and it felt as if her very heart would burst.</p>
<pre><code>#P119,T#  The villagers weren&apos;t so backward, and they warmly</code></pre><p>welcomed the sisters.  These people hated slave traders and they liked</p>
<p>people who were good hard workers just like they were.</p>
<pre><code>#P119,BR#  That night, as always, her heart was terribly heavy and</code></pre><p>the yakkul, too, was sniffling.  For the longest time, it wouldn’t calm</p>
<p>down.</p>
<pre><code>#P119,BL#  Suddenly, Tea felt as if she&apos;d heard something like</code></pre><p>Shuna’s voice calling for assistance.</p>
<pre><code>#P120,R#  Tea saddled up the yakkul without hesitation and went down</code></pre><p>to the to the south.  But when she came to the entrance of the village,</p>
<p>beyond which point there were no houses, she saw what looked like a</p>
<p>wretched devil making his way up the road to the valley.</p>
<pre><code>#P120,L#  Tea called out Shuna&apos;s name.  Slowly, Shuna turned toward</code></pre><p>her, with hollow-looking eyes.</p>
<pre><code>#P121#  Tea took Shuna to the storeroom where they themselves lived.</code></pre><p>Shuna was oblivious to everything.  Without so much as a memory, a word,</p>
<p>a name, a feeling… Fearing the fire, he crouched in the darkness and</p>
<p>ate greedily.</p>
<pre><code>#P122,T#  The bag that hung around Shuna&apos;s neck looked like</code></pre><p>something important, so Tea opened it for a look.</p>
<pre><code>#P122,MR#  Golden heads of grain...

#P122,ML#  She felt a warmth coming to her heart, and the tears</code></pre><p>nearly fell.</p>
<pre><code>#P122,BR#  Taking a needle and thread and cloth that she&apos;d woven,</code></pre><p>Tea began to repair Shuna’s clothes.  What had his body been through?</p>
<p>Tea could not even guess.  #P122,BL#  Tea only knew that this time, like</p>
<p>she’d said, she would be watching over him to give him help.</p>
<pre><code>#P123#  It was winter already.  Except when he was crouching to eat,</code></pre><p>Shuna continued to sleep through this long and gloomy time of year.  Tea</p>
<p>told neither the old woman nor the people of the village of the thing</p>
<p>Shuna had.</p>
<pre><code>#P124,T#  Slowly, spring came.  Early one morning, Tea brought Shuna</code></pre><p>outside with her.</p>
<pre><code>#P124,B#  Unobserved, they plough a little garden, and with the</code></pre><p>stones unearthed, they constructed a home for Shuna to hide in.</p>
<pre><code>#P125#  Everyday, while the people still slept, Tea brought out food</code></pre><p>and water.  The old woman complained, “The food will soon run out,” but</p>
<p>Tea continued to bring out her own rations.</p>
<pre><code>#P126,T#  Shuna was clutching the bag.  He could not easily plant</code></pre><p>the seeds.  Slowly, patiently, Tea taught him.  And in the middle of the</p>
<p>night, Shuna dug up the seeds he’d planted, one by one, and replaced them</p>
<p>in his bag.  #P126,BR#  Despite this, Tea worked harder than ever.  If</p>
<p>they could harvest from the small amount Shuna had, they would have even</p>
<p>more.</p>
<pre><code>#P126,BL#  At night, after her work at the house was done, she spun</code></pre><p>thread and weaved cloth.  #P127,TR#  And even when she was exhausted and</p>
<p>saw the little light burning on the mountain, it gave her a warm feeling.</p>
<pre><code>#P127,TL#  It was at Shuna&apos;s refuge that the wood fire burned.</code></pre><p>Gathering a small amount of firewood everyday, and kindling the fire,</p>
<p>became the job of the younger sister.</p>
<pre><code>#P127,BR#  One morning...

#P127,BL#  Creeping from his house, Shuna stared steadily at the</code></pre><p>garden.  The golden species had sent forth its first sprouts.</p>
<pre><code>#P128,R#  Seeing the green sprouts, Tea&apos;s little sister laughed in a</code></pre><p>bright voice.  The child that had not laughed since the manhunters had</p>
<p>burned her country was now spinning round and round, dancing.</p>
<pre><code>#P128,L#  Since that time, a faint smile had come to Shuna&apos;s face.

#P129#  The day for the festival of the summer solstice was near.</code></pre><p>The old woman called Tea.  “You are becoming of that age where you should</p>
<p>like to become intimate with a good strong worker.”  She told her to</p>
<p>select her groom from among the young men of the village.</p>
<pre><code>&quot;I don&apos;t want to, and if you want to throw me out of the house,</code></pre><p>that’s fine.”</p>
<pre><code>&quot;Just be quick,&quot; she said, not accepting Tea&apos;s words.

The night before the festival, Tea sewed Shuna clothes from the</code></pre><p>cloth she’d woven.</p>
<pre><code>#P130,T#  That day, in front of every person in the entire village,</code></pre><p>Tea would conduct the selection of her husband.</p>
<pre><code>#P130,BR#  The old woman adorned Tea, putting her in the best</code></pre><p>clothes from her own youth.</p>
<pre><code>Seeing Tea&apos;s old woman, all the young men of the village began to</code></pre><p>murmur.</p>
<pre><code>#P130,BL#  Tea said, &quot;Whoever can handle our yakkul will be my</code></pre><p>husband.”</p>
<pre><code>#P131,TR#  The proud yakkul used its antlers skillfully, and one</code></pre><p>rider after another fell off.  #P131,TL#  The entire village could not</p>
<p>stop laughing.</p>
<pre><code>#P131,B#  After the last of the suitors had failed, Tea&apos;s little</code></pre><p>sister led a familiar youth forward by the hand.  The young man wore</p>
<p>clothes of yakkul fur.  Immediately, the villagers knew that the faithful</p>
<p>mount would not run away from this master.  The old woman was mortified,</p>
<p>but the villagers, satisfied, returned to their homes.</p>
<pre><code>#P133,T#  One clear day, Tea was working in a distant pasture,</code></pre><p>cutting grass.  Suddenly, an icy wind blew, and black clouds advanced</p>
<p>from the mountains.  #P132#  The brief summer of the northern provinces</p>
<p>had come.  It was strange how lush and green the small garden became, and</p>
<p>how, with this, there came a lightening of Shuna’s expression.  #P133,B#</p>
<p>Tea ran toward it.</p>
<pre><code>Soon, there was thunder, and ice pellets mixed with rain began to</code></pre><p>fall.</p>
<pre><code>[At the besieged garden Tea found Shuna.]

#P134#  Tea encouraged Shuna to spread a cloth, protecting the</code></pre><p>field.  Large pellets of hail struck them both violently, and chopped</p>
<p>down the grass around them.  At that time, it was very dark there, and</p>
<p>the storm blew thunderously.</p>
<pre><code>#P136,T#  The two of them had defended the field.  As the storm was</code></pre><p>passing, the blue sky peeped out at her face, and Tea heard her own name</p>
<p>being called.  #P136,BL#  “Tea…”</p>
<pre><code>#P137,R#  Shuna had recovered his speech.

#P137,L#  Bursting the dam, Tea&apos;s tears flowed.  The girl who hadn&apos;t</code></pre><p>cried since her village was burned was taken by Shuna in his arms and</p>
<p>wept violently.</p>
<pre><code>#P139#  Slowly, the crops took their color, and like he himself,</code></pre><p>were ripening.</p>
<pre><code>Shuna recovered.

#P140,T#  Fall...

#P140,M#  Finally, the day came.

#P140,BR#  Someone was knocking at the door.

#P140,BL#  Tea opened the door.

#P141#  Carrying the sheaf of wheat he&apos;d harvested, Shuna stood</code></pre><p>there, looking like someone just back from a long journey.</p>
<pre><code>&quot;Shuna...&quot; (Tea said.)

#P143#  Quietly, but with the profoundest joy, the two sat down side</code></pre><p>by side.</p>
<pre><code>It was over...

Now, the moon traveled across the sky, and wandering after it were</code></pre><p>manhunters.  At any rate, they’d survived that ordeal before.</p>
<pre><code>#P144#  With a view to return to the valley of his birth, Shuna</code></pre><p>stayed in that area another year.  With the villagers, he battled the</p>
<p>attacking manhunters, driving them out into the desert.  After the last</p>
<p>harvest, the wheat field was expanded, making the next harvest much</p>
<p>bigger.</p>
<pre><code>#P145#  When the day of departure arrived, they were able to leave</code></pre><p>half the seeds of the golden wheat with the people of the village.  The</p>
<p>people regretfully bid them farewell.  Even the old woman, who continues</p>
<p>to lament about not having one of the young villagers as a son-in-law,</p>
<p>gave Tea her late husband’s rifle.</p>
<pre><code>#P147#  Shuna&apos;s journey isn&apos;t over.  The road back to his valley is</code></pre><p>long.  No doubt, there were other problems, but that is a story that will</p>
<p>be told another time.</p>

<pre><code>To Steven and all, regarding Kinokuniyas: you ask why isn&apos;t there</code></pre><p>mention of Kinokuniyas on the net?  Heck, I don’t know.  It’s NOT a</p>
<p>fan-oriented store.  It’s a Japanese-person-oriented store.  But anyone</p>
<p>can go in there and shop, and anyone can order from them.  The $4.40</p>
<p>price for Nausicaa GN #5 was what I paid (before Calif state tax) when I</p>
<p>went to pick it up.  I’m sure if they mail it out to you, they’ll charge</p>
<p>for mailing it out to you, but other than that, and tax if you live in</p>
<p>the state of the store you call, there are no other surcharges.  It’s a</p>
<p>great store to live by.  Their anime selection is large (not HUGE, but</p>
<p>fairly good), and they have lots of neato Japanese magazines, from</p>
<p>ANIMAGE to game/computer stuffs, to childrens stuffs, etc.  There is a</p>
<p>large Japanese/ Japanese-American population here, so…</p>
<pre><code>As far as I know, this store doesn&apos;t keep a mailing list, but they</code></pre><p>WILL do orders for you on an individual basis.  They might also do</p>
<p>successive orders (ie, ordering a year’s worth of a japanese magazine,</p>
<p>say), though I’m not sure, and am only guessing.  As I said before, the</p>
<p>only info I have is basically having lived next to one, although… now</p>
<p>that I think about it, I DID order books through the mail once from</p>
<p>Kinokuniya San Jose with a Visa card about 3 years ago.  They were very</p>
<p>helpful, and sent it out in the mail.  The mail costs vary, but it’s just</p>
<p>typical mail costs (books, computer chips, etc.  A few bucks unless it’s</p>
<p>really heavy), so it’s no great cost there.  The same about as, say,</p>
<p>ordering from Nikaku… You know, just normal mail costs.  I ordered the</p>
<p>original “Mai”s from them (vols 1-6) about 3-4 years ago.  They came in 2</p>
<p>days (though I do live in the same state, about 500 miles south), and</p>
<p>were in good condition.</p>
<pre><code>If you know exactly what you want, and call and order it, and they</code></pre><p>had it in stock, it’s no problem.  If they have Nausicaa #5 in stock, and</p>
<p>you call, give a VISA card, they’ll be happy to send it to you.  If they</p>
<p>DON’T have it in stock at the time you call, you’d have to ask them what</p>
<p>their mail policy is (as far as special ordering it via mail).  Their</p>
<p>walk-in order policy is friendly (fill out a postcard.  When the book</p>
<p>comes in,they send out the postcard, and you can come pick it up).  On</p>
<p>the instances that I’ve ordered like this, it’s been pretty good</p>
<p>speed-wise (for a special order anyway… never more than 1 month,</p>
<p>usually 2 weeks or so)….</p>
